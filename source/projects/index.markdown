Here's a list of projects that I've created.  They have varying levels of
completion and documentation.

<h2>dfm - the dotfiles manager</h2>

Dfm is a utility that manages dotfiles. It makes it easy to install (and
uninstall) your dotfiles on new servers as well as fetch and merge changes from
other machines, and simplifies working with your dotfiles repository no matter
what directory you are in.

* Homepage: <https://github.com/justone/dfm>
* Documentation: <https://github.com/justone/dotfiles/wiki>
* Blog posts: ['dfm' archives](/category/dfm/)
* Starter repo: <https://github.com/justone/dotfiles>

<h2>dockviz - visualize Docker data</h2>

Dockviz is a utility for visualizing various Docker data.  It is primarily used
to show the hierarchy of image layers.  It was initially part of Docker core
but was split out a couple years ago.

<h2>pmb - the personal message bus</h2>

The personal message bus is a system for bringing disparate agents together
securely for personal productivity.  The first use case was copying remote data
to the local clipboard, but it has expanded to streaming log files and remote
notification.

<h2>skeg - simple docker development environments</h2>

Skeg greatly simplifies the process of isolating your development environment
in a Docker container.  It looks something like a lightweight vagrant.

<h2>holen - utility fetcher</h2>

Holen is a utility that fetches utilities, somewhat like Homebrew, but focused
on static binaries and Docker images that contain a single utility.  Plus, it
works on Linux and Windows too.

<h2>Smaller projects</h2>

* [git_backup.pl](https://github.com/justone/git_backup) - easily backup with git
* [remotecopy](https://github.com/justone/remotecopy) - copy data from remote terminals into your local clipboard
* [outputdiff](https://github.com/justone/outputdiff) - quickly find differences in output
