One of my resolutions for the new year (I'll list them all later), is to get organized.  I know that "get organized" is a wonderfully vague goal, but for me it just means that I want to do the following three things:
<ul>
	<li>Forget fewer tasks</li>
	<li>Spend less time thinking about what I have to do and more time doing it</li>
	<li>Always have something to look for when I'm at the bookstore/library or the movie theater/rental shop.</li>
</ul>
To this end, I've employed a few tools to help me in this process:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a> - For those unfamiliar with RTM, it's a fancy to-do list manager.  It has quite a few features, but the most important is the ability to tag tasks.  This opens it up to pretty much any organizational style.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> - This site helps me organize all the books I have read, am reading, or want to read.  It has a decent interface with just a few quirks that basically gets out of the way.</li>
</ul>
I wish there was a site similar to Goodreads for my other great hobby, movie watching.  I'm sure someone's thought of it, so maybe someday I'll ask Google.

That's all for now.
