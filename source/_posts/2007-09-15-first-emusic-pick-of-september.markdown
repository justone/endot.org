Well, I waited too long to get my picks for August and they expired on me.  Rats.

So I thought I'd try to look earlier in the month this time around and I stumbled across Dave Barnes' <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/-Chasing-Mississippi-MP3-Download/11007736.html" target="_blank">Chasing Mississippi</a>.  I can't quite figure out why I like it yet, but it definitely has some catchy bits. Check it out.
