A great quote from one of <a href="http://loudthinking.com/">DHH</a>'s latest <a href="http://loudthinking.com/posts/36-work-on-what-you-use-and-share-the-rest">posts</a>:
<blockquote>There's absolutely no pleasing everyone. You can't and shouldn't try to make everyone love you. The best you can do is make sure that they're hating you for the right reasons.</blockquote>
Being a people pleaser by nature, learning the above has been tough for me.Â  Especially lately.
