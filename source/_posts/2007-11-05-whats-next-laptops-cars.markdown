As seen in a Vons in Riverside.  All models of iPod are represented as well as digital cameras and accessories for all. It was quite sophisticated, with a touch screen menu and everything.

The prices were on par with what you'd find in the Apple store.

I just can't see picking up an iPod at a Vons.Â  You know, "it was an impulse buy, near the register...."
