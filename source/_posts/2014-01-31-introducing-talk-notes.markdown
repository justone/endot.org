In the course of my work and my online reading and research, I often come across videos of talks that I want to watch.  I rarely take the time to watch those videos, mostly because of the time commitment; I usually only have a few minutes to spare.

Lately, I've done something to change that.  I'm taking a little bit of time out of my Friday schedule each week to watch a talk that looks interesting.  I also try and focus on the talk.  Rather than checking my email or chatting while the talk is playing, I take notes, sometimes including screenshots of important slides.

Over the course of the past month, I've had some success with this strategy, and I was able to watch three talks.  Here are links to my notes:

* [Using Datomic With Riak](/notes/2014-01-10-using-datomic-with-riak/) - I picked this talk because we've used a bit of Riak at work and a buddy of mine keeps raving about Datomic.  This talk is actually a great overview of the philosophy and design behind Datomic.
* [Raft - the Understandable Distributed Protocol](/notes/2014-01-24-raft-the-understandable-distributed-protocol/) - CoreOS's [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) has been getting some mention lately, and [Raft](http://raftconsensus.github.io/) is the consensus algorithm used to keep all of its data consistent.  At the end of watching this talk, I found another one (by one of the Raft authors), and it balanced the practicality of the first with some more of the theory.
* [React - Rethinking Best Practices](/notes/2014-01-30-react-rethinking-best-practices/) - The functional programming paradigm is gathering steam, and Facebook's [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) JavaScript library is a fascinating take on building modern web UIs in a functional manner.

I really enjoyed the process of taking notes in this way, and I hope to continue this as the year progresses.

Oh, and if you know of a good talk, please let me know [on twitter](https://twitter.com/ndj).
