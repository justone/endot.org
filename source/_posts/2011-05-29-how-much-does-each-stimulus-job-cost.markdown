While reading a <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/mayjune_2011/features/the_information_sage029137.php?page=all">recent article on Edward Tufte</a>, I went over to <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/">recovery.gov</a> and came across a data set that details <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/pages/textview.aspx?data=recipientHomeMap">how much money each state has received and how many jobs were created</a>. Â I'd just found out about <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3.js</a> and so I used it to create a visualization of <a href="http://projects.endot.org/viz/recovery.gov/cost.html">how much each job cost</a>:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://projects.endot.org/viz/recovery.gov/cost.html" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-263 aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="job cost" src="http://endot.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/cost_small.png" alt="" width="320" height="480" /></a></p>
