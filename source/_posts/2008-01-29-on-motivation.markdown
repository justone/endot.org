Now that I've started organizing myself into discrete lists of projects and contexts, I feel the weight of remembering all those tasks lifting from my mind.  But even as I began this endeavor, I quickly ran into the problem of motivation. I had planned on a longer entry about this, but today I found another blog post that <a href="http://pigpog.com/node/1462">echoed my thoughts exactly</a>.

Basically:
<ol>
	<li>The best way to get things done is to <strong>do them</strong>.</li>
	<li>The best way to <em>do them</em> is to <strong>start doing them</strong>.</li>
	<li>GTD is of <strong>no help at all</strong> with making you <strong>want to do things</strong>.</li>
</ol>
Motivation to get things done is more important than organizing those things.  Motivation, however, is much harder to come by.

I can think of one way that organizing helps.  By taking more things out of your mind, you are less weary when it comes to doing tasks, and therefore are more likely to tackle them (and avoid the <a href="http://www.lifeclever.com/the-lightning-bolt/">strike of lightning</a>).
