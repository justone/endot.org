I've been meaning to blog about this for about two months, so here's a bit of background.

Back in October, a <a href="http://serialized.net/">friend</a> (and <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">coworker</a>) of mine and I decided to start playing around with simple electronics in our spare time.  We both bought the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=17&amp;products_id=68">Arduino starter kit</a> from Adafruit and during our first meeting, quickly worked through the first few <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/">tutorial lessons at ladyada.net</a>.  It didn't take long before we decided to meet every Tuesday for lunch and hack on our new hobby.

In the 4 or 5 meetings we've had so far, we breadboarded an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Punk_Console">APC</a> (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/serialized/3113565509/">video</a>), scavenged spare parts off a CD-ROM drive and he started putting together a motor shield, among other things.

Sara got me a soldering iron for Christmas and I've been accumulating the necessary tools over the past few weeks, and this past weekend I finally felt ready to do something serious.

When we go up to visit Sara's Grandma, they usually go out thrift store shopping and leave me at home to entertain myself.  I usually read or watch TV, but this time, I set up a small work area and proceeded to go through some of the <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/learn/multimeter/">ladyada.net tutorials</a>.  I first learned how to use my multimeter.  I hadn't ever used one, so I tested continuity, resistance and voltage on nearly everything I had.

Next, I used my soldering iron for the first time.  I joined a couple of jumper wires together with a hook in each and then soldered them together.  It was a little shaky at first, but I eventually made it stick.

With my new found skills, I proceeded to put my <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/pshield/solder.html">Arduino protoshield together</a>. It took me almost two hours, but by the end I had made more than 70 connections and tested them all for continuity.

Here are a couple pictures of the finished shield first next to, then on top of my Arduino:

After I finished the shield (and ate a bit of lunch), I cleaned up my work area and pursued other activities until Sara returned from her shopping.  I learned in <a href="http://www.solarbotics.com/products/jbb/">Junkbots, Bugbots, and Bots on Wheels</a> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman">walkmans</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discman">discmans</a> were good candidates for scavenging parts, so Sara picked up a few used ones while she was out.  I spent a good bit of time in the evening disassembling them and I was pleasantly surprised to see all the good parts these little devices offer.  I was also surprised at how different each of the three were internally.

All in all, it was a good day of electronics nerdery.
