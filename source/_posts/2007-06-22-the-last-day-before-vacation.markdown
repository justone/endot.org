So I'm going on a long vacation next week, and today was my last day of work for a little while.  I've noticed a common theme among the days that precede a vacation.  They're usually fraught with a flurry of random tasks that all must be completed before the vacation can begin.  There are also several trick workarounds and special procedures that need to be scripted or documented so that if this certain server or that random process were to crash, someone other than me would be able to get it back up and running without rousing me from my self induced slumber.

Today was very much so one of those days.
