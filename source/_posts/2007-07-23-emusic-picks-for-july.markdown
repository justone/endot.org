A while ago, one of my <a href="http://serialized.net/" target="_blank">coworkers</a> told me about <a href="http://emusic.com/" target="_blank">eMusic</a>, and I've been a subscriber ever since.  I've found some great music over the past year, so I thought I'd start sharing what I download.

I have the (now legacy) 40 download per month account.  It's a great value for only $9.99 a month.

This month, I went for comedy.
<ul>
	<li>John Heffron: <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/John-Heffron-Good-Kid-Bad-Adult-MP3-Download/10977850.html" target="_blank">Good Kid, Bad Adult</a> - Heffron won Last Comic Standing a few years ago, and his "big kid" style is hilarious.</li>
	<li>Brian Regan: <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/Brian-Regan-Brian-Regan-Live-MP3-Download/10976907.html" target="_blank">Brian Regan Live</a> - my cousin <a href="http://emilybelsey.com/" target="_blank">Emily</a> introduced me to Brian last month, and he gets extra points for doing almost an hour that's totally clean.</li>
	<li>Maria Bamford: <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/Maria-Bamford-The-Burning-Bridges-Tour-MP3-Download/10864288.html" target="_blank">The Burning Bridges Tour</a> - I only had 3 tracks left, so I started this album, which has most of the content from her Comedy Central Presents show that I saw a few years ago.  Very odd, but funny.</li>
</ul>
That's it for July.  My downloads refresh at the end of every month, so it'll be around that time that I post.

Have fun.
