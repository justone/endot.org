So, I got a new Macbook Pro, and I must say that the MagSafe power cable is neat.

Funny thing is, every once in a while, when my mind is otherwise occupied, I find myself disconnecting and reconnecting the cable.  Not because someone's tripped over the cord, but because magnets are cool.

I doubt the Apple engineers had that in mind.
