Well, I didn't get much of a chance to blog about the NDWall milestone 2 before it flew past this last Saturday.  Dave and I agreed a few weeks ago that milestone 2 would include the following features:
<ul>
	<li>Add a configuration/settings area for the application.  The keys are: Display Name, Username, Password, URL</li>
	<li>Move the downloading of new messages into a thread so that it happens in thebackground.</li>
</ul>
We set the deadline for this milestone to be last Saturday, the 17th of January.  I guess the first few weeks of the year got away from me, because by the time I woke up Saturday morning, I'd only done the first half of the
assignment.  Add that to the fact that I was out of network range this past weekend (due to a wonderful trip to see Sara's Grandma), and it's time for me to add a virtual $20 to the jar.

I'll post again when I finish up this milestone and we figure out what milestone 3 holds.
