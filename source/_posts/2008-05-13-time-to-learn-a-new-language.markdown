The recommendation I've heard most is that you should learn a new programming language once a year.  I'm thinking my next one should be a functional language, like Erlang or Haskell.

I saw a <a href="http://slickorslack.com/codes/61">Haskell snip</a> today on <a href="http://slickorslack.com/">Slick or Slack</a>, and it definitely piqued my interest.
