A couple days ago, I did a presentation on my <a href="/2010/10/16/dfm-a-utility-to-manage-dotfiles/">dotfiles manager (dfm)</a> at the <a href="http://losangeles.pm.org/">local Perl Mongers</a> meeting.  It was a phenomenally rewarding experience.  The Perl community has always been fun and engaging and this meeting was no different.

Here's the <a href="https://github.com/justone/dfm_present">source for the slides</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/downloads/justone/dfm_present/dfm_present.pdf">PDF rendering</a> for ease of perusing.  It's a good overview of current usage as well as a laundry list of future features.

Enjoy.

<strong>Update:</strong> Here are the slides, hosted by <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/">speakerdeck.com</a>
