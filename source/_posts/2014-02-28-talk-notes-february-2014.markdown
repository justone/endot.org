I was out of town two of the Fridays this month, so I was only able to get two talks in:

* [Clojure core.async](/notes/2014-02-14-core-async-clojure/) - Continuing in my fascination with Clojure, I picked this talk to explore the non-Java techniques for handling concurrency.  I'm familiar with [CSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) from my Go experience, and it was interesting to hear Clojure's take on the same foundation.  Clojure also implements a macro that turns the spaghetti code that is callbacks into a sequential function that still operates asynchronously.
* [Inventing on Principle](/notes/2014-02-21-inventing-on-principle/) - Several people have recommended this talk to me, and I finally got around to watching it.  It's worth the watch just for the amazing demos that he built, but the deeper notion that there could be an underlying principle that guides your life is thought provoking.  It also makes me want to play with [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com/).

Enjoy.
