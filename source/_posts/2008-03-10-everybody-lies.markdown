From the Norman essay:

Logic and reason, I have to keep explaining, are wonderful virtues, but they are irrelevant in describing human behavior. Trying to prove a point through intelligent, reasonable argumentation is what I call the "engineer’s fallacy." (Also, the "economist’s fallacy.")  We have to design for the way people really <strong>behave</strong>, not as engineers or economists would <strong>prefer</strong> them to behave.

I find myself re-learning this again and again.
