From <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/11/19.html" target="_blank">this post</a> on the venerable <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Joel on Software</a>:

Go to <a href="http://walkscore.com/" target="_blank">walkscore.com</a>, and type in your address.  What you'll get is a score with detailed locations of common destinations within walking distance.

My work got a 66.  Where I went to college got a 72.

And my current residence gets a 75.

Walkability is one of the things that influenced us when we bought our home and why we like living in this area so much.
