<img src="/uploads/2007/07/img_1638.JPG" title="img_1638.JPG" alt="img_1638.JPG" align="left" />My name is Nate.

That's me, with my wife Sara somewhere up the coast of California.

Most of our happenings together show up on <a href="http://joneses.us/" target="_blank">our blog</a>, so this is area is more for my thoughts and rants.

I'm mostly interested in programming and technology in general and their application to make people's lives better, but I will most likely deviate into my other interests from time to time.  These include soccer, movies, books, and may even cover political or religious subjects.

I hope you enjoy reading my stuff.  I certainly enjoy writing it.
